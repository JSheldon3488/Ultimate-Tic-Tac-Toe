Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe in Java FX

How to Play: Run main in UltimateGameTTT.kt

Current Status:

I had a working single game tic tac toe (with unit tests for engine) and am now in the process of expanding it to ultimate tic tactoe.
When I changed the structure to ultimate tic tac toe the engine changed and therefore I currently do not have a working engine with
unit tests. I do have the ultimate board displaying correctly and enabling and disabling boards correctly. Below is my todo list.
    
    
To-Do List:

    1. Write the ultimate engine (done)

    2. Add functionality for draws to ultimate engine and TTTengine (done)
    
    3. Write unit tests for the ultimate engine
    
    4. Rewrite unit tests for the individual TTTengine (board inside ultimate board)
    
    5. Create an engine interface that my engines implement (and extend because subtle differences between the two)
    
    6. Create Main Menu Sceen and End of Game Sceen
    
    7. Refactor
    
    8. Refactor
    
    9. Refactor
